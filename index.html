<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  mrda [--developer] [--architect] [--leader] [--community] [--other] <br>
</p>

<h1>SUMMARY</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  I'm passionate &amp; customer-focused, and able to develop software, lead
  teams, architect systems, and find innovative solutions to deliver great
  outcomes.
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  My proven skills span many technology domains in a wide range of industries,
  and this gives me the ability to bridge the divide between technology and
  business. I am capable of leading design discussions around a whiteboard,
  mentoring developers, explaining technical concepts to project managers and
  clients, collaborating remotely with the open-source community, and
  presenting at conferences.
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  I think cross functionally, applying expertise gained from large to small
  sized companies, including those in open-source, defence, telecommunications
  and aerospace domains. I thrive on new challenges and love to drive
  continuous improvement in organisations.
</p>
<p class="subtext">
My expertise includes:<br>
<p class="doublesubtext">
* Software Development<br>
* Software Architecture<br>
* Open-Source Software and Community<br>
* Managing Teams<br>
* Problem Solving and Lateral Thinking<br>
* SCRUM and Agile Methodology<br>
* Public Speaking<br>
</p>
</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p class="subtextheader">
  --developer
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Extensive experience developing software in many languages including python,
  C, ansible, bash, Java and perl, developing on or for Linux, Windows, and
  OS X platforms.  Some highlights are:
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Development in python and ansible, adding support for baremetal server
  provisioning to the Rackspace Private Cloud (RPC) product. This involved
  contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/openstack/ironic">ironic</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/openstack/nova">nova</a>, and
  <a href="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible">openstack-ansible</a>
  OpenStack projects and starting the
  <a href="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-ironic">
  openstack-ansible-ironic</a> project.  Backported this new functionality into
  an existing supported product release to ensure the satisfaction of a
  strategic customer.  Some of my OpenStack commits are listed here:
  <a href="https://mrda.io/resume/openstack.html">https://mrda.io/resume/openstack.html</a>
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Represented Rackspace at OpenStack Summits, design mid-cycles, and
  other open-source conferences, giving presentations and participating in
  design discussions.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Development of a sit-in simulator and embedded system written in C and Fortan,
  controlled via an X-Windows application written in C++ that resulted in the
  on-time and on-budget delivery of a challenging project that won an Australian
  government award for small project delivery.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Refactoring of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) written in C running on a
  Smartcard Operating System to enable speed/size trade-offs to be analysed, and adding
  support for additional cryptographic algorithms.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Development of a distributed C++, POSIX threaded, TCP/IP client/server
  application running on Linux and Solaris, allowing compute intensive
  bottlenecks to be overcome through parallelisation.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Handheld GPS application development in python, with Linux kernel modifications
  in C.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Reverse engineered, and reimplemented in bash, a deployment system for a
  complex multi-node cloud-hosted PHP application that made use of mysql,
  redis, varnish, and nginx in an AWS environment.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Development of a decoupled, fully redundant set of distributed Java services,
  using Apache ServiceMix and ActiveMQ, to provide a business-critical,
  multi-region, multi-brand, customer web facing capability.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Creation of local development environments that simulate production
  cloud-hosted web applications using docker and shell-scripting.
</p>
<p class="triplesubtext">
  Developer of <a href="https://github.com/mrda/junkcode/">junkcode</a> and
  useful miscellania.
</p>

<p class="subtextheader">
  --architect
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Overseas secondment to Illinois, USA for 6 months joining a team of
  architects planning the merging of 3 acquired competing products,
  implemented in enterprise Java and .NET technologies, into
  a new single product line.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Designed approaches for migrating customers and services as a result of
  company mergers, allowing new customers to sign-up while providing a seamless
  migration path for existing customers.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Led the technical activities for a new system to qualify customers prior to
  signup, creating an evolving product roadmap, developing architecture and
  design artefacts in UML, ownership of the XML data model, and providing
  support to the development team.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Primary technical contact for the integration of a cloud-hosted application
  into the existing staff workflow. Day-to-day management of the development
  team building integration web services, and management of the external
  sofwtare vendor.  The end result was the adoption of a new CRM system, and
  the deprecation of an existing home-grown solution.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Led the Requirements Gathering and Software Architecture discussions in
  pre-sales and pre-project start up capacities at different organisations
  across several projects.
</p>

<p class="subtextheader">
  --leader
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Oversaw the development of a family of related products – a smartcard
  operating system, a Windows application for loading applets onto the
  smartcard, and an e-wallet applet – across a team of 30 software engineers,
  ensuring timely delivery and an integrated release schedule.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Leading a team of work-from-home software developers geographically spread
  across Australia, all contributing to an upstream open-source project,
  providing coverage over different domain areas so as to build a
  cross-functional skunkworks team.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Started a new project and led a team to develop Java software on a mobile
  phone: from initial customer contact, requirements gathering, through to
  design and prototyping. This was made more challenging as the customer was
  based in Tokyo, Japan but resulted in building a relationship with a new
  customer in a different market than we had been operating in.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Lead and managed the day-to-day activities for a 20-person team supporting
  customer &amp; staff web applications. This involved both strategic planning
  while providing day-to-day support, allowing business-as-usual activities to
  continue while planning for the replacement and retirement of tools.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Managed 35 cross-functional developers, including HTML/CSS designers,
  Javascript and PHP developers, and devops engineers: creating career
  development plans, providing performance feedback, refining and documenting
  software processes, and developing position descriptions for all staff.
  Built the company leadership team, proposing strategic initiatives,
  implemented accountability for action items, planning staff resourcing needs,
  and growing the number of technical staff by 50% in less than a year in
  response to strong growth in the business.
</p>

<p class="subtextheader">
  --community
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Passionate about Linux and open-source, I've been continuously involved with
  the FOSS community since I started using Red Hat Linux 5.0 and Linux kernel
  0.99.something, contributing and supporting the community in a number of ways.
